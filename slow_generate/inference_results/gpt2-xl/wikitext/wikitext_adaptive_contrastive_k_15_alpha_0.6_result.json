This is known as gentrification. In my research, I have found that there are at least two factors that contribute to this phenomenon: 1) rent control and 2) land use restrictions. Let's take a look at each of these in turn.\n\n\nRent Control Restricts Demographics The most obvious way that rent control limits the supply of housing is by raising the price of housing. For example, California Proposition 13, passed in 1978, requires developers to set aside a certain percentage of units for low-income families. This has the effect of creating a de facto rent control, since the market does not work in the long run as it does in other states. As a result, prices go up, even during recessions. When housing prices are high, it is harder for people to afford living in San Francisco. This, in turn, discourages people from moving here in the first place. Land Use Restrictions Demographics Many cities have \"urban villages\" or \"granny flats\" that are designed to provide housing for elderly people. These housing units are illegal in most of the Bay Area, but not in San Francisco. Because of this, the city has an oversupply of"

Confederate General Jubal Early was attempting to break through the Union lines by launching a surprise attack on the Union encampment at Cedar Creek. In the confusion, an artillery shell went off and mortally wounded Early. His body was taken back to Fort Pillow, and a funeral was held to honor the fallen general. This resulted in the firing of the city's first salvo of musket volleys, which is commemorated every July 4th and has been a tradition since at least the 19th century.\n\nIt was during the Civil War that Meridian began to grow at a rapid pace.

        "reference_text": " are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects. The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n",

At that time, Ireland was a pagan country, and the pagans believed that the sea was the abode of demons. This belief was based on the belief that demons lived in the sea, and their dwelling place was known as the Liffey Trench. To placate the demons, St. Patrick prayed to the sea god Tuam, who granted him a sign that the demons were appeased. After three days of drinking copious amounts of seawater, an irate demon appeared in the form of a sea-serpent and attempted to strangle St. Patrick. The miracle of the sea-serpent's coming to his aid was enough to quell the demon, and all was well.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why the fisherman's superstition holds true. First, the Irish have a long history of seafaring, and fishing is a way of life for many of them. Second, as far as we know, no one has ever died from ingesting seawater. In fact, some studies have shown that fish are one of the safest foods to eat,"

Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \" Heart \" ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it. The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album Disco Four. Madonna's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook.

Dailor went on to say that this photo helped him get into the mind of the song's protagonist, Nick Lachey, and what he was going through at the time. As far as the lyrical content goes, Lachey's relationship with his ex-girlfriend is one of the most talked about in the music industry these days. The two broke up in the summer of '09, and shortly after her move to Los Angeles, Lachey filed for divorce. It was a rocky relationship that took its toll on every aspect of his life, not the least of which was his self-esteem.\n\nAccording to The Fader, which broke the story last year, Lachey began drinking heavily and taking hallucinogenic drugs as a way to cope with his broken relationship.

The evaporation of the snowmelt results in a drop in temperature of 2-3 degrees Centigrade (Celcius). This drop in temperature acts as a thermostat to regulate the growth of leafy vegetation and, in turn, the food supply for the herbivores. As the temperature drops, the plants wilt and go dormant, providing a time of dormancy for the herbivores. By the time the sun comes up in the spring, the ground is covered with grasses and sedges (primarily clover and vetch) which are ready to germinate and sprout from the seedpods.

On the right flank, there was to be a \"sneak attack\" that would take advantage of the air cover provided by the Luftwaffe and Soviet MiGs.

The artillery had been in disarray for a long time, and many of its guns were no longer in working order. Sato decided to rearm the guns and reorganize them into a well-oiled machine.

It was founded by Mayan conquerors who took over the city of Palenque in 10th century A.D.

This is no fault of the road, but an intentional design that minimizes wind resistance and helps maintain a low center of gravity. At the same time, the trees are close together, making it difficult to see the contours of the mountain and what lies beneath. There are no trail junctions, so be sure to bring a map and compass. In the winter, snowdrifts up to 1/2 mile (1.6 km) high are common due to the presence of glacial ice. These have to be traversed by skiers/snowboarders, and should be avoided at all costs.

Its headquarters were located in Hemet, California, an unincorporated community in the San Fernando Valley (see Valley of the Sikhs). This area was home to over 1,000 Scientologists, many of whom were well-heeled and middle-class Californians.

It consisted of a plate of high-velocity steel (reinforced with rivets) encased in a watertight shell. The thickness of the armour was such that water could not seep through without rupturing the armour, resulting in a fire hazard. As far as we know, there were no records of it being used in WWI. Its use was discontinued in the 1920s due to cost and obsolescence. At the time of the Warring States Period (794-1127 A.D.) and the Edo Period (1185-1333 A.D.), Japanese armour was similar to that of the Mongols, in that it consisted of two or three layers of hard-plastic armour welded together. This had the advantage of being impervious to shrapnel, but was heavy and unwieldy, necessitating the use of lances rather than javelins. In the Tokugawa Period (1333-1603 A.D.), the Japanese started to experiment with more modern armour, such as wrought iron breastplates, but did not go as far as the British and were content with the protection provided by Harvey armour.

This system made use of multiple blocks, each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour. It was a lengthy, painstaking process, requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image. Hu also employed a related form of multiple @-@ block printing called \" set @-@ block printing \" ( taoban yinshua, \u5957\u677f\u5370\u5237 ), which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again. He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing ; this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible. \n",

This success was due in no small part to the fact that there was no market for poetry in the pre-literate society of the Ming dynasty. By the time of the book's publication, China was a multi-lingual society, in which every part of the country had its own language, and poetry was no exception. It was common for people to make pilgrimages to their hometowns to pay obeisance to their ancestors, and these visits took place in their native tongue. As a result, the poetic traditions of the home region were passed down from generation to generation, and poets, in turn, became familiar with the folktales and fables that served as the basis for their storytelling.

This technique is similar to the use of lacquer as a decoration in Ming ceramics.\n\n\nThere are at least two reasons for the use of blind embossing: 1) Hu had difficulty controlling the speed of the engraving, and 2) the work was time consuming and required a lot of work. For example, an image of a rooster's head was cut out of a vase, and the head was encased in a piece of copper-plated sheet metal. It was then painted with varnish so that it would stand up to the rigors of storage. After several months, the pieces were re-erected and put in storage at the Guangdong Provincial Museum in Nanchang. During this time, the museum conserved and cared for the pieces, and many of them were moved to the Louxian Archaeological Museum in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, for safekeeping.

It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well as a collection of artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple @-@ block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps.

The opening night of the tour received scathing reviews, mostly aimed at Carey's deemed \" obvious \" stage @-@ fright and failure to make a connection with the crowd. Succeeding nights were more favorably reviewed, with critics raving about Carey's vocals. Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote regarding Carey's live vocals, \" Beyond any doubt, Ms. Carey's voice is no studio concoction. Her range extends from a rich, husky alto to dog @-@ whistle high notes ; she can linger over sensual turns, growl with playful confidence, syncopate like a scat singer. \" However, after the strong media attention, Carey did not visit the US on her succeeding Daydream World Tour in 1996, visiting only Europe and Asia. The tour in contrast, received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike, as well as breaking ticket sale records. Carey's three shows at Japan's largest stadium, Tokyo Dome, sold out in under three hours, equaling in over 150 @,@ 000 tickets, setting the record of fastest show sellouts in Japan's history. On the Butterfly World Tour, Carey broke the record, selling 200 @,@ 000 tickets in under one hour. During 1997, after the commercially and critically successful release of Butterfly, Carey had not planned to tour once again, due to the long travel times and strain on her voice. However, due to overwhelming demand by fans, Carey agreed to perform in Asia once again, only extending the tour to Taiwan and Australia, as well as one last show in the United States. Rehearsals for the show began shortly after Christmas 1997, extending for a period of two weeks. \n",

By the 1880s, the boom in lumber had reached a fever pitch, thanks to the opening of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 and the California Gold Rush in 1848. Thousands of Californians flocked to the Sierra Nevada foothills to work the sawmills, log cabins, and canneries that sprawled across the land like spiderwebs. In less than a decade, California's lumber industry boomed from a little more than 1,000 trees per hectare to an all-time high of 2,566 trees per hectare. This was no small feat, considering that the state's tree densities were in the single digits as recently as the Civil War.

At the same time, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) people were the subject of a wide range of policy and institutional responses to their dispossession and assimilation. These range from land reclamation and self-government on the South Australian and Northern Territory constitutions, to the Australian Capital Territory (ACTA) Act 1894, which set up the Constitution and Legislative Assembly of the Commonwealth of Australia to be known as the Commonwealth of Australia as at 1 July 1901.

At the head of the war effort was Brigadier-General Gwyn Morritt, who had come to command the 3rd Armoured Division in December 1899. Morritt's task was to reorganise the BEF into a well-oiled fighting machine by the end of the year, and this turned out to be a Herculean task. As well as re-equipping the Divisions, Morritt set about the task of building fortifications around the front so that the troops could stay in place rather than running away to regroup. These defences were known as Cemeteries, and consisted of barbed wire entanglements strung across the battlefield. Each Cemetery was manned by a company of Territorials, whose job was to shoot to kill anyone attempting to cross the barricades. If an enemy soldier got the drop on the Tommies, they were shot without hesitation.

In this article, I look at the history of Australia's war on terror and what it means for the future of national security.\n\nAUSTRALIA'S WAR ON TERROR\n\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, the world woke up to a new reality. Terrorists had attacked the United States, killing almost 3,000 people. Within hours, President George W. Bush declared a war on terror, and Australian troops were deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan. Their mission was to train and work with the Afghan National Army (ANA) in counter-insurgency operations against the Taliban guerrillas. These operations were called Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). After the war in Afghanistan, the ANA was re-integrated into the Afghan National Army and, by the end of 2003, about 90 per cent of the ANA had been demobilised. This resulted in a loss of personnel and materiel, not to mention the damage to the ANA's reputation as a fighting force.\n\nIt was an unenviable post-war situation for Australia, which had fought a war in Indochina (Vietnam) and two in Papua New Guinea (Timor-Leste and Bougainville). As a result, there was a lot of scepticism about the value of military adventurism in the 21"

As an act of charity, he set up a race between two universities, Oxford and St Edmund Hall, to raise money for the war effort. This proved to be a resounding success, and over the years it has grown into a much larger event than it was originally intended to be. For more information on the history of the Boat Race, see the Oxford Historical Society's page on the Boat Race.\n\nOrganisational and Sponsorship Edit\n\nThe Boat Race is the brainchild of the Oxford Dictatorship, a non-profit organisation that seeks to promote inter-university camaraderie and good sportsmanship. They do this by organising boat races every year, along with social events such as polo matches and picnics. Since its"

Both teams batted with vigour, and there was no mistaking the scoreline for the half-hour that went by between the two teams.\n\nOxford made the first breakthrough to the crease when Ben Foakes opened the batting with a bouncer to Trent Boult, bowled in the offspinner's paradise of No. 3. Boult was unable to hold the bails of his yorker, and the ball skidded through the leg side for four. This was followed by a run-out appeal, which was disallowed by umpire Nigel Llong, who adjudged that the ball had deflected off Graeme Swann's bat.

At that time, the territory was known as the Shawnee Nation, and consisted of present-day South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. In 1832, President Andrew Jackson signed the Treaty of Sandusky, which ceded the Black Hills to the United States for $15 million in gold and 18,000 acres of land in perpetuity. As a result of this treaty, the Cherokee were no longer required to pay taxes, and no longer had to live in the reservation they had been living on for 200 years.\n\nAboriginal Traits\n\nOne of the most notable traits of the Cherokee is their belief in reincarnation. This belief is reflected in their word for \"sun\" (Cherokee sunwaw), which means \"heaven\" in their language. They also believe that there are a number of spirits that inhabit the earth, and that each of these spirits has a part to play in the life of the individual. Some of these"

His student Ch\u016bgan Engetsu composed many kanshi which were clearly stated \" influenced by Du Fu \" in their prefaces. Ch\u016bgan's student Gid\u014d Sh\u016bshin had close connection with the Court and Ashikaga Shogunate and propagated Du Fu's poetry in the mundane world ; one day Nij\u014d Yoshimoto, the Kampaku regent of the Court and the highest authority of renga poetry, asked Gid\u014d, \" Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li Bai? \" Gid\u014d dared to reply, \" Yes if you do have enough capability. No if do not. \" Since then, there had been many seminars on Du Fu's poetry both in Zen temples and in the aristocratic society, and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the Muromachi period, e.g., Taiheiki, a historical epic in the late 14th century, and some noh plays such as Hyakuman, Bash\u014d, and Shunkan. \n",

He studied at the court of the Emperor Taizong for two years before moving to Edo (present-day Tokyo) to become a court poet. During his time in Edo, he fell in love with a concubine with whom he had a son. The marriage was annulled on the grounds of incompatibility, and this created a rift between Bai Juyi and his son. In an attempt to mend the rift, Bai Juyi began to write poetry, which was received with mixed reviews. It was not until the death of the Emperor Huanghong in 1279 that Bai Juyi was able to rekindle his love affair with his son-in-law. By this time, Du Fu had made his way to Kamakura, and, inspired by the poet's poetry, set out to establish himself as a poet of his own. As a result, he won the favor of the empress Dowager Hez\u014fn, who gave him a stipend of 100,000 taels of silken cloth every year.

One of the earliest mentions of a battleship was in the Treaty of Versailles in 1815, which stipulated that France would be responsible for building at least one \"armored frigate\" for the United States. This led to the construction of the Royal Navy's first-ever warship, the Dreadnought Charles Napier, in 1817. However, the Navy was short on frigates at the time, and Charles Napier was decommissioned two years later for not being seaworthy. [1]\n\nAs a result, the Admiralty set about procuring a new warship that would be capable of fighting in the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans. On the other hand, naval construction had reached a standstill due to the Civil War, and there was no money to be made in shipbuilding. This was the impetus for the Navy to re-examine the possibilities of construction of a fleet-defenseless battleship. By 1820, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, a well-"

This ratio, Sat\u014d theorized, would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict.

This resulted in a displacement/rigidity ratio of 1.33, which equated to a more maneuverable ship in order to fight at a faster cadence. As a result, the Japanese Navy began to rely on the ship for escorting convoys and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) in the Far East. By the time World War II broke out, the number of destroyers had increased to the point where there were no battleships of the Type 0-1 class available to the Japanese Navy. It was decided to re-equip the fleet with a fleet of ships that more closely resembled the type of ships that had been used in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.

As a result, the gun did not have the armor that was required for long range defense. This in turn resulted in a high rate of fire at close range, not the best for a battle tank. Another problem was the ammunition. All weapons have a trade off between damage and lethality. The M1917A1 had a muzzle velocity of 1,890 feet per second (fps) and a cyclic rate of 1,000 rounds per minute (rpm). This meant that the gun was capable of destroying a B-17 Flying Fortress at a range of 20 miles (32 km; 18 mi). However, due to the lack of armor, the crew was exposed to small arms"

It was an all-welded belt made of high-strength steels and laminated at the waterline to prevent fraying. There were two types of belt: 1) a \"floating\" belt in which the rivets were fastened to the belt; and 2) a \"cradled\" belt in which the rivets were welded to the belt. The belt was designed to be watertight, but this was not a requirement due to the weight of the ship. As a result, the belt was susceptible to punctures and water ingress. In any case, such damage was of little consequence to the ship, which was protected by the belt.\n\n\nThe Ise @-@ class, along with the Akizuki Maru, were the first battleships to be fitted with anti-torpedo bulges under the waterline.

I'm not sure if this was intentional or not, but it was an unfortunate side effect of the design.\n\n\nAfter World War II, the United States of America took over the decommissioned ships and refitted them with U.S. Navy ordnance. Some of the modifications were carried out retroactively, such as the addition of anti-torpedo bulges to the superstructure. These bulges were intended to counter the damage caused by torpedoes, but did little to help the survivability of the ship. As a result, the USS Saratoga was re-designated the USS Nautilus in the 1950s. This name was taken from the mythological creature that dwells in the sea, and is able to change its shape at will.

One of the most famous examples of this was the U.S. Navy's Battleship Potemkin, which saw service in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and World War I. However, the type did not see widespread use until the Second World War, when the Royal Navy (R.N.) began to look for a replacement for cruisers and destroyers, in addition to aircraft carriers. At the same time, the Soviet Union was making a push into the Pacific, and saw the need for a carrier-based AA unit as well. It was this that led to the creation of the Zvezda (\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430, Severnaya) class of battleships, which were armed with long-range torpedoes and machine guns for AA defense.

This is due to the fact that it is the fuel that powers the propellers and provides the power to move the ship from one place to another. To this end, torpedoes and depth charges are a must, as well as machine guns and howitzers. These weapons come in all shapes and sizes, and there are no two that are alike. Each and every one of them has a range, damage per salvo, and fire rate that is suited to the task at hand. For example, a.50 caliber machine gun at 100 yards will do more damage than a high explosive (HE) shell at the same range. The difference is one of time of flight, in other words, how long it takes the shell to reach its target. HE shells travel at a speed of 1,000 feet per second, while subsonic (under Mach 1) or supersonic (over Mach 1) are more maneuverable and have a higher rate of fire.

From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, when the UN forces, under the Eighth United States Army, established the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army. \n",

This increase in size necessitated the development of steam-powered ironclads such as the \"Dunkerque\" at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805-1806. These steamships were faster and more maneuverable than their barbette forerunners, but suffered from a lack of ballast and, in the event of a collision, were at the mercy of the wind and waves. As a result, there were few if any battleships of this type in service until the Great War.\n\nModern-day ironclads have come a long way since their heyday.

Ericsson's turret turned on a central spindle, and Coles's turned on a ring of bearings. Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns, but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s. The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging, so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads. The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy. Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard. The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour. Low freeboard, however, also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage \u2014 and therefore range of the vessel. In many respects, the turreted, low @-@ freeboard Monitor and the broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an'Ironclad'was all about. The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes, or'squaring this circle ', was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles : HMS Captain, a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail, and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870. Her half @-@ sister HMS Monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams.

As early as the 1860s, large-scale smelting of iron took place in Saint Petersburg, followed by a more modest but still significant output over the next 50 years. In the mid-19th century, the demand for steels became such that, due to oversupply, steel prices shot up to double the pre-boom price. These high prices were passed on to the consumer, who ended up paying two to three times the price of a year before. To put this in perspective, the price of copper was $1.50 per pound in 1860, compared to $1.50 in the year 2000.\n\n\n"

The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time. Small, regularly spaced pits are the first to form, followed by larger ridges.

The postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull, with ossification ( the replacement of cartilage by bone ) happening more slowly. Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed, ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages, and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development. Once maturity is reached, most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows. The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks, possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons.

But what is it about these 'roly-poly' animals that leads to such a large number of spine-bearing appendages?\n\nNew research from the University of Exeter has shed light on the secret, uncovering that there are at least two mechanisms by which roly-poly animals are able to grow so many bony protrusions.\n\nThe first is due to the growth of cartilage, which acts as a scaffold for the growth of bone. This, in turn, results in the body becoming stiffer and more bone-like. By contrast, the second mechanism has to do with the ability of osteoblasts, which are cells that take up calcium from the bone, to proliferate at a faster rate than non-osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are responsible for the bulk of the bones in the body, and their rate of proliferation is the key to the increase in bone mass.\n\nLead researcher Dr Chris Wilkins, Lecturer in Integrative Biology at the University of Exeter, said: \"We were surprised to find that not only do bones grow in proportion to the body size of the animal, but that the number of bones goes up with body size.

After the capitulation at Ulm, isolated portions of the Austrian military evaded capture and joined with their Russian allies ; Michael von Kienmayer's corps slipped out of the encirclement and joined Kutuzov's force. A few other small forces refused to capitulate and seemingly melted into the Bavarian mountains and the Thurgingian forests, to reappear in Bohemia for Austerlitz. Sixteen hundred cavalry, including Archduke Ferdinand and Prince Schwarzenberg, broke out of Ulm before its capitulation. Maximilian, Count of Merveldt, led his column back through the mountains into Austria, fighting rear guard actions against pursuing French forces at the Steyer ( Steyr ) and Mariazell. These elusive units were insufficient to balance heavy losses at key battles in which the Austrians could not hold their own against the French.

This was met with approval by Vince McMahon, who had no qualms about taking a man who wrestled for WCW as a babyface and turning him heel just two years later.\n\nTriple H's plan was to have Shane McMahon (Brock's father) act as the middle man in the match, and in order to do this, he needed one or two \"yes\" votes from the locker room. The stipulation was that if Shane was voted in, he would lose his World Title to Brock the following night. It was Shane's idea to have Paul Bearer, the son of Bobby Heenan, in the back of the limo that would transport Shane to the arena. Bearer was given the job of making sure Shane got in the car and did not end up in the middle of the ring at any point during the match.\n\nShane arrived at the Universal Studios parking lot in Burbank, California, along with Stephanie McMahon, Trish Stratus, Rob Van Dam, Chris Jericho, Kurt Angle, Mick Foley, Booker T, Ric Flair"

This loss was Lesnar's first pinfall loss in WWE and led Lesnar to turn for the first time in his career into a fan favorite. Following Survivor Series, Heyman made it clear that Lesnar would not get a rematch, and had snuck a special clause saying so into his contract. In order to gain his revenge on Big Show and Heyman, Lesnar interfered in his first title defense, which came against Kurt Angle the next month at Armageddon. Lesnar hit the F @-@ 5 on the champion, which enabled Angle to pin him and win the title. On the following episode of SmackDown!, however, Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and, despite promising Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening, declared that Lesnar still would not get it. Lesnar was beaten down by Big Show and Angle after the main event, but would get his revenge after the show went off the air. He eventually knocked the Big Show out with a steel chair, leaving Angle alone with Lesnar. Lesnar then chased the champion out of the ring and resumed his assault that culminated when Lesnar used the F @-@ 5 to propel Angle's right knee into the steel ringpost.

This would have the effect of \"freeing up\" the space in the filter, and in doing so allow one to use a much smaller resonant frequency as the cut-off frequency. Of course, there are tradeoffs to be made in this, such as not being able to tune the filter to very low frequencies, and more importantly, you have to deal with the fact that the bandwidth of the filter is going to be less than the square root of the resonant frequency. That's a lot of bandwidth to give up for a couple of decibels of attenuation.\n\n\nAs an aside, my understanding is that the frequency at which the filter is no longer resonant is known as the cutoff frequency. This is due to the fact that the energy radiated by the resonance is dissipated in the form of heat, and as the cutoff frequency approaches the resonant frequency, the loss of energy starts to outstrip the gain of the filter.

There are a number of factors that play into this, but the most important of these is the size of the inductor. Larger inductors have a more difficult time dissipating power, and as a result tend to be more expensive. For this reason, it is common to see designs consisting of a series of coils wound around a core, rather than a single coil.

The bulldog did not fare well in World War 2, and was superseded by the Chieftain series of tanks.\n\n\nSources: A History of the British Armoured Forces, R.D.

Suspension was on eight road wheels, four per side, with no separate driver or idler wheels and it was capable of a 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) top speed. The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier Vickers models. The front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by bending the tracks. For sharper turns, the system returned to the conventional method of braking one track to turn the tank ; the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the MkVII and reduce its power wastage. The suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for springing and cushions of oil for damping, and each of the wheels was independently sprung. \n",

This can be seen in the photo below which shows the glacis plate of a Sturmpanzer IV being shot to pieces by a high explosive shell.\nThe reason for this is that the angle of the armour is such that it deflects the shrapnel away from the crew and armour, rather than in front of it.

By the time the war was over, over 1,000 Hurricanes had been built, of which more than a third were in service with the Royal Navy.\n\n\nThere were a number of reasons for the Hawk's inferiority to the Swordfish. For one thing, the Hurricane was the only aircraft of its type to be mass-produced in Great Britain, rather than the U.S. of A. Another problem was structural, as the fuselage of the Hurricane was more aerodynamic than that of the Swordfish. These factors were outweighed by the speed and maneuverability of the Hurricane, which made it a more effective anti-submarine fighter than the Swordfish.\n\n\nTetrarch continued to operate until it was decommissioned in the 1970s, and remains in mothballs to this day.

The Lend @-@ Lease program, begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China, was therefore extended to the USSR. As part of the program, the British government began supplying war materials to the USSR, which in early 1942, included a shipment of 20 Tetrarchs, as well as a number of Valentine and Matilda Mk I Infantry tanks. The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British, and so could use the Tetrarchs. When the tanks arrived in the USSR, however, it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions ; additionally, the cold weather had a deleterious effect on the tank's suspension and tracks. Additional testing of the Tetrarchs was conducted by the Soviet military and the design was admired for its controllability, manoeuvrability, and speed, as well its ability to run on low @-@ quality fuel, unlike contemporary Soviet designs. The thinness of the Tetrarch's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved, as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank's speed.

On 24 May 1944, after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres,'A'Squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at Tarrant Rushton airfield, while the rest of the regiment moved to RAF Brize Norton airfield the next day ; from these two airfields, the regiment would be transported from to participate in the British airborne landings in Normandy. The operation began on the night of 5 June, with the deployment of 6th Airborne Division to eastern Normandy. It was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the Allied seaborne landings, securing strategically important areas east of Caen, capturing several important bridges over the Caen Canal and River Dives, and destroying a coastal artillery battery. Insufficient transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division's brigades simultaneously ; one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day. Major General Richard Gale had initially intended for the 6th Airlanding Brigade, to which the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was attached, to be landed first ; however, aerial photography revealed that anti @-@ glider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade. Therefore, Gale decided that the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade ( which did not utilise gliders ) should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones, allowing the 6th Airlanding Brigade to land in the second lift. \n",

It had thicker armour than the Tetrarch, with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of 38 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) and the side armour to 17 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 67 in ), and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to help deflect shells fired at the tank.

The new tank was no longer air @-@ portable, as it was too heavy to be carried by a Hamilcar.

A third possibility is that it was an adornment for the person who held it in his/her hand. These theories have not been disproven, but their plausibility is debatable.

One side is decorated with a double @-@ disc motif that may have been repeated on the other ; if so, damage to the right side has obliterated any trace of it. The top of the headdress is decorated with the clawed foot of a bird of prey. Either straps or plaits of hair descend on either side of the face, from the headdress to the base of the monument. Only one earspool survives ; it is flat, in the form of a rounded square, and is decorated with a cross motif. The ears have been completely eroded away and the lips are damaged. The surviving features display a frown and creasing around the nose and cheeks. The head displays prominent teeth. \n",

Some theories suggest that the head was part of a sacrificial offering to the god Quetzalcoatl, who was believed to have presided over the sun and the rising and setting of the sun.

The Sun is a star, but it is in the middle of a sunspot cycle known as Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). These eruptions of electrically charged protons and electrons are the result of the Sun's magnetic field fluctuating in and out of alignment with the Earth's magnetic field. As the Earth rotates, the magnetic field lines of longitude and latitude (e.g., N, S, E) come into and out of alignment with each other, like marbles in a slot machine. This causes the Sun's magnetic field to wobble back and forth by as much as 10 nanoseconds (one quadrillionth of a second). On average, the Sun's magnetic field is at its strongest during the Northern Hemisphere winter solstice, which occurs on June 21-22, and weakest during the Southern Hemisphere summer solstice, which occurs on July 21-22.

Through this examination of Lester's life, rebirth and death, American Beauty satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction. Even Lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela ; he therefore remains a \" willing devotee of the popular media's exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness \". Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness ; from her belief in \" house beautiful \" domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn's domain is a \" fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or Eden \". The Burnhams are unaware that they are \" materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically \" who expect the \" rudiments of American beauty \" to give them happiness.

This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill. Hall shot American Beauty in a 2 @.@ 39 : 1 aspect ratio in the Super 35 format, using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 35 mm film stock. He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal @-@ filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within. He shot the whole film at the same T @-@ stop ( T1.9 ) ; given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high @-@ speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects. He used Panavision Platinum cameras with the company's Primo series of prime and zoom lenses. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and EXR 5248 stock for scenes with daylight effects.

When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35 \u2013 anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended. \n",

In the politically charged atmosphere of the day in Boston, Selfridge, fearing for his own safety, had armed himself with a dueling pistol. The younger Austin had, apparently on his own initiative, sought to beat Selfridge with a cane, and Selfridge fatally shot him in the encounter. Selfridge was prosecuted by Attorney General ( and future Gore gubernatorial opponent ) James Sullivan, and the defense also included arch @-@ Federalist Harrison Gray Otis. Gore argued Selfridge acted in self @-@ defense ; Selfridge was acquitted of murder by a jury whose foreman was Patriot and Federalist Paul Revere after fifteen minutes'deliberation. \n",

As we have seen, Gerry Adams was one of the leaders of the Provisional IRA, and many of his supporters were drawn from the rank and file. It is fair to say that, by the time of the Omagh bombing, the leadership of the IRA had become disillusioned with the tactics of paramilitaries and sought to reassert control over the organisation.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in did not take this step without a fight. In an attempt to neutralise the power of the UVF and UDA, it set up a splinter group, the Continuity IRA, which operated in the north of Ireland for several years. These attacks were carried out with the connivance of the security forces, and resulted in the deaths of at least one police officer and more than a dozen civilians. Despite this, the SDLP-Sinn F\u00e9in government continued to give succour to the British government in its war against the IRA.\n\nA political stalemate was reached in the Stormont Assembly in January 1972, when the Democratic Unionist Party ("

This did not sit well with vocalist Jeff Tweedy, who felt that nothing had changed in the band other than the name. Tweedy began an acrimonious war of words with label Epitaph, in which he refused to release the album on the label due to contractual obligations. The record was re-released on EPs and cassettes, but never sold well to begin with. It was a slow death for the band, ending in mid-1997 with the disbandment of the quintet.

This resulted in the population of the city growing to several million people, which in turn led to an overpopulation of the watercourses that bordered the city. To deal with this, the city built canals, a system of aqueducts and dikes in order to divert water from the Yangtze River and Lake Taihuttu to irrigate the arid land around the city.

In an effort to keep drivers from clogging up the roads, New York City has taken to erecting barricades that are designed to slow traffic to a crawl. One of the most well-known is the 18th Street Viaduct, which rises 1,890 feet above the Hudson River. This high-ceilinged structure provides vehicular access to Midtown Manhattan, but at the same time obstructs sightlines for drivers trying to get to the rest of the city. As a result, the construction of the viaduct has been a thorn in the side of city planners for years.

View Larger Map\n\nIn the 1970s, construction began on the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) to New York City's West Side, which would provide a high-speed connection between Hoboken and Secaucus, New Jersey. After years of delays, the HBLR opened in 1981, and was followed by the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) in the '90s. Both of these intermodal systems rely on trains traveling at speeds of up to 120 mph (193 km/h; 100 mph or more in the case of the LIRR). This is in contrast to the NJ Transit system, which operates much slower, at a maximum speed of 50 mph (80 km/h; 40 mph or more in the case of the Maspeth-Flatbush Rapid Transit line). As a result, there are frequent delays, which result in overcrowding on the train and, in turn, lead to poor commutes for those who live in the vicinity of the stations. To address this problem, Metro-North has taken the initiative to reroute the Route 9 line so that it no longer traverses the center of Hoboken. By doing so, the Line 9 is able to continue its use as a commuter line, rather than an intermodal line.\n"

To do so, the railroad was to have two trestles, known as the Rock Island and Mohawk Trestles, which straddled the Mississippi River just north of what is now Lake Champlain. These trestles were constructed in the 1830s and '40s, but it was not until the mid-19th century that work began on the Rock Island Suspension Bridge, which spanned the bridge-tunnel to the west and opened in 1853. At the time, the Great Lakes were navigable by steamship, and steamboats plied the lake-harbor route between St. Louis and New York every day. This necessitated the construction of canals, wharves, and piers to facilitate the movement of freight and passengers. On July 1, 1853, the U.S. Army took over the construction of the Rock Island Suspension Bridge, and for the next 40 years, the bridge played a vital role in the country's transportation system."

This legend goes like this:\n\nOne day, some time in the eleventh century, a group of Knights Templars went to the abbey of St Hilary in Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne as messengers of the Holy Sepulchre.

As is the case with most of the design features of the ship, there were a number of problems to be solved, including the need to make the hull sloped at the waterline, rather than flat, to prevent capsizing in rough seas. Also, an air conditioner was added to the superstructure, along with a ballast tank below the waterline. These changes were necessitated by the fact that the hull was too heavy to be towed by a schooner.\n\n\nThe most significant change to the UB I was the addition of a rudder for maneuvering in choppy seas.

The escorts were supposed to provide cover for the attack on Gibraltar, but this did not happen. At some point during the convoy's journey, the torpedo boats began to run aground due to bad weather. It was decided to wait until the weather cleared before resupplying the convoy. By the time the convoy got under way, the British Admiralty had lost confidence in the protection provided by the escorts and was in the process of dispatching them to North Africa. As a result, the escort task force was decimated to the point that not a single destroyer was left in the Mediterranean. To make matters worse, the Royal Navy, which had suffered a great deal of casualties in the Battle of Jutland, no longer had the strength to deal with the newly liberated land of the Afrika Korps. This is one of the reasons why the United States of America declared war on Germany on 7 August 1940. (Sources: Naval History and Heritage Command ("

When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert.

One day, he ran into Jackie Gleason, who was trying to get out of Las Vegas. The two hit it off and went to a racetrack owned by Jack Nicklaus. After an intense bet, Nicklaus won the race and promised to give Eddie a million dollars if he won the next one. Eddie's money was safe, but it came at a price. In order to be in the money, Eddie had to do a lap of the track under the tutelage of Dr. Ziegler, a hypnotist with a sadistic side. This proved to be a bad omen for Eddie, as Ziegler started torturing Eddie with electroshock therapy, which resulted in Eddie's death.\n\nPersonality Edit\n\nAt first, Eddie was a jovial, carefree gambler, but over time he lost his inhibitions and took on a life of depravity. He enjoyed the limelight and flaunted his wealth, while living lavishly in Beverly Hills. The last we see of him is on the cover of Esquire magazine, smiling for the camera like a rock star.\n\nBehind the scenes Edit\n\nThis character was based on Newman's real-life friend, casino magnate Eddie Bernad"
