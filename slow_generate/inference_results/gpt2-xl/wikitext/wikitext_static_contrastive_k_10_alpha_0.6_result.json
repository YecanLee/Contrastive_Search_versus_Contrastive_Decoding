Also, a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker was placed in Oak Grove Cemetery in honor of Rodgers on June 1, 2010. Each year since 1953, the city has held a festival during May to honor the anniversary of his death. \n",

As a result we are keen to find ways of increasing the population of the island without resorting to population control measures which are inimical to human rights and democratic principles. This paper sets out a proposal for an open and participatory democracy based on self-governing communities that has been developed in consultation with and with the support of the islanders and their representatives. The aim is to build a community-centred, non-hierarchical, democratic system of decision-making, in which everyone has an equal say in how the island is run and decisions are made by consensus rather than majority rule.\n\nFunding: No external funding for this project was received.

Tikal may have come to have been called this because Dos Pilas also came to use the same emblem glyph ; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name.

It's hard to tell from the video, but I'm going to guess that this is the first time in the history of human civilization that a couple has gotten married on the steps of the British Monarchy without the Queen of Englis... er, Buckingham Palace in attendance. After the ceremony, everyone goes their separate ways, Peter to his home in West Hampstead, and Olivia to New York (or whatever the capital of the United States is these days). While on the train, Peter starts reminiscing about his days growing up"

The tour in contrast, received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike, as well as breaking ticket sale records. Carey's three shows at Japan's largest stadium, Tokyo Dome, sold out in under three hours, equaling in over 150 @,@ 000 tickets, setting the record of fastest show sellouts in Japan's history. On the Butterfly World Tour, Carey broke the record, selling 200 @,@ 000 tickets in under one hour. During 1997, after the commercially and critically successful release of Butterfly, Carey had not planned to tour once again, due to the long travel times and strain on her voice. However, due to overwhelming demand by fans, Carey agreed to perform in Asia once again, only extending the tour to Taiwan and Australia, as well as one last show in the United States. Rehearsals for the show began shortly after Christmas 1997, extending for a period of two weeks. \n",

We find that there is a positive relationship between population decline and war (r = 0.36), but this relationship is driven by the post-invasion period from 1945 to the Korean War in the 1950s and not the pre-1939 period as suggested by previous research.

One of the most well-known was the Taiping Rebellion (1850\u20131864), which sought to unify China under Manchu rule by overthrowing the Qing emperors and taking control of the country. However, the Taiping Rebellion was short-lived, lasting no more than two years before falling apart in disarray. In 1864, an American-backed army led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek succeeded in driving the British and French out of China, and by the mid-1870s China was in the hands of the Republic of China (ROC), a self-governing confederation of over 1,000 ethnic and religious groups based in Canton, Guangdong Province.

The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901, when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created. This new force also lacked blue water capable ships, and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy. In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient.

This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700 @-@ ton River @-@ class destroyers.

One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth Rexroth's One Hundred Poems From the Chinese. His are free translations, which seek to conceal the parallelisms through enjambement and expansion and contraction of the content ; his responses to the allusions are firstly to omit most of these poems from his selection, and secondly to \" translate out \" the references in those works which he does select. \n",

One of the most important was the need to provide protection against depth charges in the event of a torpedo attack. It was decided that the ship would be equipped with a \"bunker\" which would serve as a place of refuge for the crew and their valuables when they were in danger of being cut to pieces by torpedoes. This was an important consideration to the Admiralty and, in the end, the decision was made to equip the destroyers with one or at any rate two bunkers as well as the Type XXI cruisers with an air raid shelter. These changes took place in April/May 1943 at Tsingtao Shipyard No. 1 in Shandong Province, China. After this change of plans, construction was delayed for a few months due to the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post @-@ storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon.

It's a steamship that can be made of iron as opposed to steel. This has a number of advantages including lower maintenance because the ship is easier to maintain and less expensive to build. In addition, iron cladding is lighter and more cost effective than steel, which is the material of choice for today's high-end warships. The advantage of iron is that it takes less heat to melt it to form a ship's plating (iron melts at 700 degrees fahrenheit, steel at 1,000 degrees fahrenheit). This, combined with the fact that ships have a longer life span than steel ships, results in fewer rusting and maintenance issues. As a corollary, a ship of this type does not rust as quickly as a steel ship due to the lack of corrosion that comes into play when water penetrates the steel and corrodes it over time.

The result was the construction of two Warrior @-@ class ironclads ; HMS Warrior and HMS Black Prince.

The use of iron in the construction of Warrior also came with some drawbacks ; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls, and iron was more susceptible to fouling by marine life. \n",

It was thought that this would give the Beagle a longer range and be able to patrol the North Sea more effectively, and this proved to be the case for a few years. However, by the time the wars with Prussia broke out in 1807-1808, the need for a ship that could keep up with the enemy had receded, and the British government took the decision to focus on an ironclad rather than cruisers. As a result, the design went through a number of changes, most of which were for the better.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, the hull was lengthened by 20 feet (6.1m; 10ft 6in) to increase buoyancy in rough weather.

Ericsson's turret turned on a central spindle, and Coles's turned on a ring of bearings. Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns, but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s. The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging, so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads. The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy. Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard. The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour. Low freeboard, however, also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage \u2014 and therefore range of the vessel. In many respects, the turreted, low @-@ freeboard Monitor and the broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an'Ironclad'was all about. The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes, or'squaring this circle ', was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles : HMS Captain, a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail, and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870. Her half @-@ sister HMS Monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams.

The battlecruiser Jean Bart du Guesclin completed construction in 1801, and by this time France had become militarily and diplomatically dominant in the Mediterranean and North African seas.

The method is internally consistent in that it constrains rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity. Some tropical cyclones fluctuate in strength more than the 2 @.@ 5 T numbers per day limit allowed by the rule, which can work to the technique's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s.

Another advantage of the technique is that it is less affected by spatial autocorrelation, the so-called Lorenz-Fitzsimmons effect, which results from the clustering of closely spaced observations in time and space due to time lags in the meteorological data processing and data assimilation processes in the troposcale and mesoscale circulation models. This effect is less pronounced than the effect of long-wavelength dispersion in the intensity estimates of baroclinic and extratropical convective systems and can be reduced to insignificance by accounting for the fact that there are several timeslots in a 24-hour time series, each of which contributes to the sum of the time series at that time of observation.

However, in July, Heyman turned on Punk, and claimed that Punk could not beat Lesnar, which led to Lesnar making his return and attacking Punk on the July 15 episode of Raw.

Suspension was on eight road wheels, four per side, with no separate driver or idler wheels and it was capable of a 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) top speed. The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier Vickers models. The front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by bending the tracks. For sharper turns, the system returned to the conventional method of braking one track to turn the tank ; the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the MkVII and reduce its power wastage. The suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for springing and cushions of oil for damping, and each of the wheels was independently sprung. \n",

The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British, and so could use the Tetrarchs. When the tanks arrived in the USSR, however, it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions ; additionally, the cold weather had a deleterious effect on the tank's suspension and tracks.

The regiment consisted of a Headquarters Squadron, a Light Tank Squadron and a Reconnaissance Squadron ; two Tetrarchs, the Mark 1 CS variation, were attached to the Headquarters Squadron, but the Light Tank Squadron, also known as'A'Squadron, received the majority of the Tetrarchs.'A'Squadron had approximately nineteen Tetrarchs split between six troops, two of which were of the CS variation and the rest were armed with 2 pounders fitted with Littlejohn adaptors. On 24 May 1944, after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres,'A'Squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at Tarrant Rushton airfield, while the rest of the regiment moved to RAF Brize Norton airfield the next day ; from these two airfields, the regiment would be transported from to participate in the British airborne landings in Normandy. The operation began on the night of 5 June, with the deployment of 6th Airborne Division to eastern Normandy. It was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the Allied seaborne landings, securing strategically important areas east of Caen, capturing several important bridges over the Caen Canal and River Dives, and destroying a coastal artillery battery. Insufficient transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division's brigades simultaneously ; one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day. Major General Richard Gale had initially intended for the 6th Airlanding Brigade, to which the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was attached, to be landed first ; however, aerial photography revealed that anti @-@ glider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade. Therefore, Gale decided that the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade ( which did not utilise gliders ) should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones, allowing the 6th Airlanding Brigade to land in the second lift. \n",

Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head, and some are decorated with feathers. A head from La Venta is decorated with the head of a bird.

The head was discovered by a local farmworker and was excavated in 1965 by Luis Aveleyra and Rom\u00e1n Pi\u00f1a Chan. The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own weight and was found face down on its left hand side. In 1970 it was transported to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum's centenary exhibition. After its return to Mexico, it was placed in the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda in Mexico City. It is sculpted with a net @-@ like head covering joined together with sculpted beads. A covering descends from under the headdress to cover the back half of the neck. The headband is divided into four strips and begins above the right ear, extending around the entire head. A short strap descends from either side of the head to the ear. The ear ornaments are complex and are larger at the front of the ear than at the back. The face is that of an ageing male with the forehead creased in a frown, wrinkles under the eyes, sagging cheeks and deep creases on either side of the nose.

Some of the most well-known examples of this art are found in San Bartolo Quetzaltepec National Preserve in Chiapas, Mexico which has over a dozen examples dating from A.D. 900-1300.

Here are 5 reasons why I think Brad Stevens is one of the best coaches in the history of college basketball.\n\n1. He has a team that plays hard for each other on and off the court.\n\nOne of the things that stood out to me the most about Boston College's run to the Final Four was how they did not get complacent at any point during the tournament. The Blue Hens were able to pull off upsets against top-seeded Gonzaga and North Carolina, as well as knock off #1 Villanova in the Sweet 16. That's not to say there were no blowouts, but Boston College showed no signs of giving up until the final buzzer sounded. Stevens' team never stopped hustling from tip to tip, and when adversity presented itself, they found a way to get the job done. In short, this is a team that knows how to"

Peter Gallagher and Alison Janney were cast ( as Buddy Kane and Barbara Fitts ) after filming began in December 1998. Mendes gave Janney a book of paintings by Edvard Munch. He told her, \" Your character is in there somewhere. \" Mendes cut much of Barbara's dialogue, including conversations between Colonel Fitts and her, as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair \u2014 their humanity and vulnerability \u2014 was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence. Chris Cooper plays Colonel Fitts, Scott Bakula plays Jim Olmeyer, and Sam Robards plays Jim Berkley. Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal, happy \u2014 and boring \u2014 couple in the film. Ball's inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a \" bland, boring, heterosexual couple \" who wore matching clothes : \" I can 't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring. \" Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same forename. \n",

Spanish rule of Manila and the entire Philippine archipelago lasted for over three centuries, until 1898. At different times during the long Spanish period there were local revolts, Chinese insurrections, massive pirate attacks, great earthquakes, Dutch raids and invasion attempts, and a British occupation of the city during their unsuccessful attempt to conquer the Philippines. Order was usually quickly restored and the city returned to the business of trade. In the 19th century Manila was one of the most modern cities in Asia. Before the Spanish \u2013 American War, Manila saw the rise of the Philippine Revolution. Under the American rule following the Spanish \u2013 American War, the United States changed the official language from Spanish to English and made some changes in education, local laws and urban planning. Towards the end of World War II, during the Battle of Manila most of the city was flattened by intensive aerial bombardment by the United States Air Force. As a result, relatively little remains of Manila's prewar and colonial architecture, although there are ongoing restoration projects, especially within the old walled city, Intramuros. \n",

Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafa\u00ebl Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including type specimen, have been lost or destroyed. Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species. \n",

The government felt that it was more appropriate to entrust the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department. By early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves. With the help of Edward, Prince of Wales, Ware submitted a memorandum to the Imperial War Conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted. The suggestion was accepted and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was established by Royal Charter, with the Prince of Wales serving as president, Secretary of State for War Lord Derby as chairman and Ware as vice @-@ chairman. The Commission's undertakings began in earnest at the end of the First World War.
