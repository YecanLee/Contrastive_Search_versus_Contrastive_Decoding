One of the most notorious was the Ku Klux Klan, which gained a foothold in Meridian in the mid-1960s. Its members carried out arson attacks on black churches and synagogues, vandalized and defaced property, and engaged in acts of civil disobedience to protest the city's racially restrictive housing covenants.\n\nThe FBI opened an investigation into the KKK in 1967, but no arrests were made.

The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n",

It will go down in infamy as the day when the sun rose over the ramparts of St Helena and the sea turned red with the blood of patriots.\"\n\nBut what is Britain's most famous battle? The short answer is the Napoleonic, as far as we know. That's because no one seems to know for sure. There are a few stories, but none of them stand up to scrutiny. For one thing, most of the men who fought at Trafalgar were dead by the time the battle was fought. In other words, their memories of the battle were clouded by time and the ravages of war.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration by David Foldvari.\n\nThen there's the question of how many ships were involved. Estimates vary from as few as three to as many as 100. One thing is certain: the Royal Navy did not have a battle fleet that rivaled the power of Napoleon's Grande Arm\u00e9e. Even if we were to count all the ships that took part in the battle, it would be dwarfed by the size of the Grand Armee. That, at least, is the view"

Hurricane intensity is a function of two factors: 1) the intensity of the air that circulates over the storm and 2) the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. When it comes to tropical cyclones, the first factor is more important than the second. This is because, in the tropics, the air is warm and drier than it is in the midlatitudes.

The results, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, show that the difference is huge.\n\nCrowded air has a higher albedo than clear air, which means that sunlight reflects more than it reflects. Clouds are made of water droplets, aerosols and soot\u2014particles suspended in the air. As the temperature warms, the amount of water vapour in the air increases, and so does the reflectivity of the clouds. At the same time, there is less ozone in the atmosphere, which absorbs a lot of sunlight. These effects cancel each other out, resulting in a cooling effect that is proportional to the square of the temperature.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, an interdisciplinary team of astronomers led by J\u00f6rg Schmiedek of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, looked at what happens to clouds"

It is a two-man race between redshirt freshman Wilton Speight and true freshman J.T. Barrett. Speight has played in every game this season, completing 60.9 percent of his passes for 2,521 yards and 16 touchdowns with six interceptions. Barrett, a walk-on from Southfield, Michigan, has yet to take a snap in a game after suffering a season-ending injury in the season opener against Western Michigan. His injury was the result of a hit from defensive back Jabrill Peppers, who was suspended for the first half of the season opener for a violation of team rules.

The IHS was the first intermodal highway system in the world, and one of the first to use airfreight as a means of transporting goods. As a result, there were a number of accidents that took place on the Interstate Highway System, including the death of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 due to a head-on collision between a TWA 707 and a Cessna Caravan en route to Los Angeles.[1]\n\nConstruction\n\nOn June 1, 1956, an agreement was signed between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) to construct a four-lane highway in the Garden State. The state-owned land was divided into sections, and work began on each section in a staggered fashion over the next two years. By the end of the construction period, NJDOT had completed construction of the first section of Route 29, which was known as the State Route 29 (SR-29)"

According to legend, the Toltecs were able to establish a city by digging a canal through the sand dunes, which allowed them to travel by boat to the island of Tenochtitlan, which was at the time uninhabited. This is a reference to the canal-boring technique known as tunnelling, which was used by the Incas as well. In 1521, the Spaniards arrived in the New World, and began excavating the city with the intention of finding gold.

In 1788-89 Plymouth had been the most important settlement in the colony, home to a large number of people and an important trading post. It was at this time that the British government began to look for a way to deal with the population of the colony, which was growing at a rate of one or two per cent per annum. This rapid growth was in contrast to the much slower growth of the Aboriginal population, which was estimated to be no more than 2 per cent per annum. The colonial government decided to take action and set up a commission of enquiry to investigate the reasons for the growth of the Aboriginal population.

During the 19th century, the island was used as a dumping ground for waste from the city's cotton mills. In the 1920s, construction began on a railroad that would connect Charleston to New York City. The railroad was never built, however, and the island was abandoned for the next 50 years. Moultrie's survey is the only evidence that any attempt was made to improve the island.\n\n\nOn May 31, 1864, Confederate forces under Gen. Jubal Early landed on the island in an attempt to gain control of the harbor. The Confederates suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Sullivan's Island, which resulted in the death of more than 1,000 Union soldiers. A memorial to the fallen soldiers was erected on the island in 1885. The city of Charleston, however, did not take kindly to the memorial, and began demolishing it in the early 1900s. After years"

After that, the reader will be able to look at the strategic and tactical aspects of the campaign in greater detail.\n\nHistory of the Campaign\n\nThe war in the Pacific was in its third year, and the United States and the Soviet Union were at loggerheads over the control of the Pacific. Japanese strategists felt that it was their duty to drive the Americans out of the Far East as quickly as possible, and this was the reason for their invasion of the Philippines in December 1941. As a result, the Japanese planned a three-pronged attack: land invasion, air attack, and naval blockade. These three phases were to be carried out in the order of their priority, and the first two phases were to be combined into one, known as the Ketsu Go (Cease Fire).\n\nThe Ketsu Go was"

You have to make trade-offs, and that's the best way to learn the game. It's like cooking a meal: the more ingredients you put in, the more complicated it is to come up with a good dish. In the same way, games are made up of a lot of elements, and each of them has a role to play. Some are essential, like story and gameplay. Others are there to fill niches, like visual design and music. Still others are a byproduct of the game's design, like level design and user interface.\n\nAs a designer, you need to figure out what elements are going to be in your game, and how they're going to be used. For example, let's say you're designing a first-person shooter (FPS). The player is shooting a character in a 3D environment, and that character is moving around using a joystick.

First, it plays into the stereotype that women are weak and need to be protected from men. Second, it contributes to the idea that women have no agency, and that they're nothing more than pawns in a macho game of cat-and-mouse.\n\nThat's why so many women are turning to third-party candidates like Jill Stein and Gary Johnson to get their voices heard.

In the mean time, let's take a look at the rest of the floor.\n\n\nFirst, we need to remove the wood that is attached to the joists. This is done by cutting the wood with a hacksaw. Be careful not to cut too deep, or you will end up with a hole in the floor. It is best to start with a 1/4\" or 1/2\" cut, depending on the thickness of the wood. Once the wood is cut, it is ready to be put back into the joists.\n\n\nNext, we need to make a series of cuts to allow the wood to be pulled through the joists. These cuts are made so that the wood does not get stuck in the joists. I have found that the best way to do this is to lay the wood on its side, and have someone hold the wood in place while you cut it. This works best if you have a table saw, but if you don't have one, you can use a jigsaw or band saw. Make sure"

The Type XVII had a length of 100 metres, a beam of 18 metres and a draught of 4.5 metres. It was armed with a broadside cannon, and could carry a crew of 100 men. These ships were slow, poorly armed and lacked anti-aircraft armament. However, they were the best at their job, and their reputation was such that they were used as escorts for convoys to the West Indies and South America.\n\nHMS Beagle (Photo: Public Domain)\n\nAs well as serving as a warship, the Beagle was also an amphibious vessel, capable of traversing water at a speed of up to 10 knots.

The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901, when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created. This new force also lacked blue water capable ships, and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy. In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin was unimpressed, and in 1908 invited the American Great White Fleet to visit Australia. This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700 @-@ ton River @-@ class destroyers. The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911, absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force.

If they ran out of Indians identifiable as such, then the rest of the land would be declared surplus. So it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of Indianness that would minimize the number of Indians that were available.

In the summer of 1941, Winston Churchill wrote a letter to his son in which he expressed his belief that the war in Europe was a just war. His reasons were threefold: first, to save the lives of British and other European civilians; second, to prevent the Nazis from taking over Europe; and third, to make sure that Germany would never again be a threat to the British Empire. These and other reasons led Churchill to the conclusion that the United States should join the war on the side of Britain and her allies. As a result, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the declaration of war on September 3, 1941. On that day, more than one million Americans took to the streets in New York, Washington, and other cities to show their support for the British and their war effort. The following days and weeks were filled with a barrage of propaganda aimed at enlisting the support of the American people\u2014propaganda that was, in many ways, the same as that used by the Nazis in the 1930s.

You play as the titular boss, and every time you get a new power, you have to choose which one to use. For example, in the first level, you get telekinesis, which lets you move objects around without touching them. Later on, you get mind control, which lets you take control of other people's minds. This is great for interrogating them, but not so great for using them as cannon fodder. The game keeps you on your toes, and makes you think about what you're going to do next.

Zhuge Liang was an illegitimate son of Qin Shi Huang, and his birth was marred by a failed marriage at the age of six. After this, Zhuge Liang grew up resentful of his father's favoritism, and began to take matters into his own hands. This led to his father's death in 751, and the usurpation of the throne by his half-brother, Li Jue ( \u9ec3\u96f2 ). Zhuge Liang fled to the court of the Tang emperors, hoping to become a concubine in the future. However, the Tang had no interest in such a marriage, and sent him back to his home with a warning to stay away from the court. Zhuge Liang did not heed this warning, and decided"

As a result of this decision the Admiralty was given the go ahead to begin the design of a long range anti-submarine weapon. On the 1st of April 1941 the Ordnance Department at Harwich in Cheshire submitted a design to the Admiralty for the Type XVIII (Pompey) class of torpedo which was to be known as the Dorsal Turret Mark I. This design was based on the work done by the Naval Armament Research Establishment (NARDE) at Sheerness, with the assistance of the R.A.F. In the early part of this design work the idea of an all round turret was considered but this was found to be unsatisfactory as it would result in a loss of armament on the side of the ship which was facing the enemy.

This radar was a development of the V-2, which could detect targets at up to 100 miles (160 km) away. The aircraft carried a range of radar homing torpedoes, anti-ship missiles and depth charges. These were launched from the starboard side of the ship, and their speed was dependent on the angle of attack they were launched at. When the torpedo hit the target, it detonated on impact, blowing a hole in the target to a depth of 1,000 feet (305 m). The target was then \"tagged\" by the radar, and the range to the target was calculated. This was used to guide the torpedo detonation in the area of the target. It was hoped that this would result in a hit on the target, and if not, the ship would return to home base for refuelling. However, there were problems with the radar, such as interference from sea state changes, which led to it being phased out of service in the 1960s. A more modern version of the radar, the Mk.V-2, was used on the Harrier GR."

In court, prosecutors agreed to drop the DWI charge, but asked for a jail sentence of at least 90 days, citing the aggravating factors of being a first-time offender, having a criminal record and living in a high-crime area.

This is one of the reasons why steam power was introduced as a means of locomotion in the 1850s.\n\n\nI'm no expert on the design of the ironclad, but my guess is that it was a square-rigged steamer with a pair of masts at each end. The deck was divided into compartments, which were filled with ballast (saltpeter, etc.) and stored in casks. These cask-stored balls would be released when the ship neared the end of its voyage, and their weight would push the ship forward. As the ship neared the end of its voyage, the ballast would be jettisoned, and the ship would begin to move in the opposite direction.

This means that we have to be careful not to conflate the two in our interpretation of the Psalms. Secondly, and more importantly, the Psalms are the source of the Old Testament, and as such they are of the highest importance to the Christian faith. Thirdly, it is important to bear in mind that the Psalms of David and the Psalms of Solomon are, in general, about the same subject matter, that is, God's providence over the Israelites. In other words, both the Psalms and the Gospels are concerned with the redemption of the Israelites from their servitude in Egypt and the Promised Land.\n\nSo what does this have to do with the question of the author of the Proverbs of Solomon?

This placement is known as monophyly, and there are at least three commonly accepted methods for determining monophyly: parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian clustering. All three methods have their pros and cons, and each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Parsimony is the most common method, and it is used to determine the most parsimonious tree (e.g., the one with the fewest number of steps). Maximum likelihood is a much more powerful method, but it requires large sample sizes and the ability to deal with outliers. Bayesian clustering is similar to maximum likelihood, but it uses information from a prior distribution to assign taxa to groups. The problem with these methods is that they are computationally expensive, and many species are missing from the data set. As a result, it is not possible to make inferences about the relationships"

In 2000, paleontologists Rainer Schoch and Andrew Milner named a third major clade of stereospondyls, the Rhytidostea. This group included more primitive stereospondyls that could not be placed in either Capitosauria or Trematosauria, and included groups like Lydekkerinidae, Rhytidosteidae, and Brachyopoidea. While Capitosauria and Trematosauria are still widely used, Rhytidostea is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses.

This idea was based on the observation that birds evolved from non-avian dinosaurs, such as pterosaurs, and not from a common ancestor as had been assumed until then. In addition, the fossil record was starting to fill in the blanks that had been left by the lack of transitional fossils.\n\nBy the 1970s, paleontologists had come to the conclusion that feathers were the result of convergent evolution, rather than a feathered dinosaur-like ancestor. It was at this point that the debate turned to the question of whether or not these feathered dinosaurs were related to birds. Some palaeontologists, such as Donald Johanson, argued that they were, while others, such as Richard Leakey, pointed out that they were not.

He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus, a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax, was able to make the same movement. Paleontologist A.L.

The NHC and SH hemispheres are the most active, with over 1,000 tropical cyclones each year.

In other words, the more energy we emit, the more heat we radiate back into space.\n\nScientists have known for some time that the climate system responds to changes in energy input by changing the amount of radiation it absorbs. That's one reason why global warming is thought to be caused by the transfer of heat from the troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere) to the stratosphere (the second-heaviest layer). As the atmosphere warms, it cools the surface, which in turn radiates more heat back into space.\n\nBut it's not clear how much of the response is due to changes in the atmosphere and how much is due to changes in the ocean.

First, as pointed out by J. A. Kopp (1961), \"A comparison of the intensities of tropical cyclones with or without wind shear is, of course, a crude way of determining the intensity of a tropical cyclone\" (p. 3). This is because the winds associated with tropical cyclones are in many cases non-stationary, and in any case do not change with time. For example, an air mass moving from the equator to the tropics will have a wind shear of 0.5 m/s at the sea level, but this will be reduced to 0.1 m/s as the air descends in the tropics. This leads to the question of how to account for the change in wind shear that takes place in the tropics and is the basis for the Saffir-Simpson scale.\n\nAnother limitation of the Saffir-Simpson scale is that it does not take into account the effects of convection (convective available potential energy) on the intensity of tropical cyclones.

It's hard to say for sure, but here are some theories:\n\n1. Climate change is increasing the amount of sunlight reaching the Arctic, which in turn is melting the ice. As the ice melts, it exposes more of the ocean to sunlight, which warms it a bit. This has been happening for a while, but it's ramping up this year.\n\n2. Global warming is causing air temperatures to rise in the Arctic at a faster rate than they are in the rest of the world. This is known as El Ni\u00f1o, and it's one of the most powerful climate events on Earth. When it comes to weather, El Ni\u00f1o is like a hurricane in the Pacific Ocean, bringing warm water from the equator to the north and stormy winds from the south. The result is a weather pattern that tends to disrupt jet streams and weather patterns all over the world.\n\n3.

That night, Lesnar and McMahon were to face each other in a steel cage match with Angle as the special guest referee as per McMahon's orders on the previous week's program. During the match, Lesnar had passed out due to a staged backstage incident and McMahon was set to pin him, but Angle refused to allow McMahon to win that way. As the two men began to argue, Lesnar rose to his feet, revealing the ruse to the crowd, and F @-@ 5'd Angle. He then brutally beat Angle while McMahon watched, and celebrated with him afterwards, turning heel in the process. At SummerSlam, Lesnar lost to Angle when Angle made Lesnar tap out to the ankle lock. After that, Lesnar would cement his heel turn by brutalizing smaller wrestlers and attacking his rivals on a more consistent basis. He returned to using the F @-@ 5 to propel his opponents'legs into the ringpost, as he did to Spanky and Gowen, and interfered in Angle's matches on two separate occasions. On the September 18, 2003 episode of SmackDown!, Lesnar received his third shot at Angle in as many months when he faced the champion in a sixty @-@ minute Iron Man match for the title.

This resulted in a design that was more aerodynamic than the Vickers-Armstrong Merlin, and allowed the aircraft to climb at a higher speed when compared to the Merlin. However, the lack of a rudder was a handicap in dogfights, and many pilots complained of the difficulty of manoeuvring the aircraft into a position where it could be shot down.

The P-47 had a range of 6,000 miles (10,000 km) and could reach a speed of Mach 1.5 (1,000 mph) in less than two minutes. This was a significant improvement over the time-honored V-1 and V-2 rockets, which required at least an hour to reach their targets. As a result of the Thunderbolt's performance, the United States Navy and Marine Corps decided to purchase a total of 3,000 Thunderbolts at a cost of $100 million.

The Lend @-@ Lease program, begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China, was therefore extended to the USSR. As part of the program, the British government began supplying war materials to the USSR, which in early 1942, included a shipment of 20 Tetrarchs, as well as a number of Valentine and Matilda Mk I Infantry tanks. The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British, and so could use the Tetrarchs. When the tanks arrived in the USSR, however, it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions ; additionally, the cold weather had a deleterious effect on the tank's suspension and tracks. Additional testing of the Tetrarchs was conducted by the Soviet military and the design was admired for its controllability, manoeuvrability, and speed, as well its ability to run on low @-@ quality fuel, unlike contemporary Soviet designs. The thinness of the Tetrarch's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved, as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank's speed. Despite these drawbacks in the Tetrarch's design, Soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the T @-@ 70 light tank in use at the time, and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat. A number of Tetrarchs were sent to Tank Training Schools which were subsequently sent into battle, and in September 1943 two were assigned to the 132nd Separated Tank Battalion, which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade ; both tanks were destroyed in combat, one on 30 September and the other on 2 October, the latter a casualty of artillery fire.

It had thicker armour than the Tetrarch, with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of 38 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) and the side armour to 17 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 67 in ), and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to help deflect shells fired at the tank.

All of the stone heads have been assigned to the Preclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology, generally to the Early Preclassic ( 1500 \u2013 1000 BC ), although the two Tres Zapotes heads and the La Cobata Head are attributed to the Middle Preclassic ( 1000 \u2013 400 BC ). \n",

Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head, and some are decorated with feathers. A head from La Venta is decorated with the head of a bird.

It is one of the most famous heads in the world and a source of wonder for anyone who sees it. Its origin is shrouded in mystery, but scholars have come to believe that it was sculpted by Pachacuti, a priest of the Mayan god Quetzalcoatl. This may be an urban legend, but there is no doubt that the head is of great beauty and has been described as \"beautiful beyond description\" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In his 1887 book Myths and Legends of the Aztecs, Doyle wrote: \"I am in a state of amazement at the likeness of the head, which is inlaid with gold and rubies, and stands on a pedestal of the same material, so exquisitely fitted that one could look with the eye of a seer into the heart of the man who bore it.\" (Doyle, 1887, p. 442) A sculpture of the head was found in the ruins of Tenochtitlan, Mexico, in 1790-91 and, at that time, was thought to be a forgery. However, it was re-discovered in a museum in Tlaxcala, Mexico, in the early 1900s and proved to be genuine."

First, as far as I can tell, all of the portraits are dated by the date of the engraving, rather than the date of the painting. This is an artefact of the printing process, which was carried out in a time when it was common to do away with the letter 'e' in place of the numeral '1'. For example, the portrait of Charles II of England (c. 1560) is dated on the back of the painting by the year of the printing, as opposed to the year of the painting. In this case, the portrait was made in 1560, and the engraving was made in 1560-1561. (Note that, by the way, the title of the painting is 'The Deposition of Charles II of England' and not 'The Deposition of Charles II of England as Portrait' as some have suggested.)\n\n\nAnother reason is that the people depicted in the portraits are almost certainly fictional characters. These portraits are based on the life of an individual, not on a historical person. This has the effect of distorting the portrait in a way that exaggerates the personality of the person depicted.

This is consistent with the theory that the head was part of a pyramid-like structure that was built in the area around the time of the Mayan Collapse.

In most cases, Hall first lit the scene's subject by \" painting in \" the blacks and whites, before adding fill light, which he reflected from beadboard or white card on the ceiling. This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill. Hall shot American Beauty in a 2 @.@ 39 : 1 aspect ratio in the Super 35 format, using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 35 mm film stock. He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal @-@ filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within. He shot the whole film at the same T @-@ stop ( T1.9 ) ; given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high @-@ speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects. He used Panavision Platinum cameras with the company's Primo series of prime and zoom lenses. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and EXR 5248 stock for scenes with daylight effects. He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak's newly introduced Vision release print stock, which, combined with his contrast @-@ heavy lighting style, created a look with too much contrast. Hall contacted Kodak, who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5 % lower in contrast. Hall used a 1 / 8 inch Tiffen Black ProMist filter for almost every scene, which he said in retrospect may not have been the best choice, as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its anamorphic release print led to a slight amount of degradation ; therefore, the diffusion from the filter was not required. When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35 \u2013 anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended. \n",

Troops assigned to the battalion captured Kani\u017ea barracks in Gospi\u0107. During combat in Gospi\u0107, 30 troops of the Zrinski Battalion, assisted by Lu\u010dko SPU, captured JNA Major General Traj\u010de Krstevski, along with three armoured personnel carriers ( APCs ) and 32 soldiers. The unit was deployed to Metkovi\u0107 on 28 October, tasked with recapturing Slano from the JNA. After the deployment to Gospi\u0107, a part of the unit personnel left to Bosnia and Herzegovina anticipating further conflict there, while the remainder of the unit returned to Kumrovec. The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska \u2013 HV ) on 3 November 1991.
