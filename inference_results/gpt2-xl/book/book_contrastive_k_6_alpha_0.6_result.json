Finally, Tatum came to the most recent file. The file on which Julia had been the social worker, and had subsequently signed off as the responsible clinician on the file page. Tatum didn't see anything unusual in the case notes that would have made Julia save this particular file. This case report was a bit more detailed than the others; Tatum knew requirements for record-keeping had become more substantial over the last several decades. Julia's notes described a young man with a history of sexual abuse. Sounded to Tatum like it may have been at the hands of his step-father, but the identity of the perpetrator had been blacked out. The patient had, as a result of his experience, developed serious issues with depression, anxiety, and anger, and, subsequently, had been involved in several assault incidents, none of which had led to formal charges. Eventually, he was placed on Unit Four with the intent to keep both him and others safe until he stabilized. Tatum again read and re-read the material on the page in front of her. She could not think of any reason that Julia would have held onto these particular files individually, nor could she see any links among the cases described.

So in that sense, it's a trap. But that's not the only way to look at it.

The United States Government as taught in colleges and even some high schools across the country, are paying many land owners subsidies to not grow crops or raise livestock on their fields and these lands lay dormant. All that money is spent in the name of controlling our economy which in reality, our government has very little or no control over anyway. Tragically, part of the reason we are in this mess is because we already have too many people getting paid to do nothing. Ironically enough, it is those people who usually harass others about not doing enough to progress the workload of our country and vote to try and deny benefits to those who are legitimately injured working dangerous or difficult jobs. It would be far more effective to get a little bit out of everyone over driving those who are working into early graves. With the private distribution of wealth manipulating housing, food, career opportunity and medical costs it is no wonder not everyone is having their needs met. The U.S Human Expedition would use volunteers out in the fields we have paid an overabundance to do nothing with to feed the hungry and show the world that our strength is supported by compassion. I cannot stress enough that our government should not be passing this opportunity onto religious organizations. The Expedition would offer dorms or apartments to get people off the streets and allow those who have been struggling against poverty to stabilize themselves and stand on their own feet once more or even for the first time. With the U.S. Human Expedition in place and in co-operation with President Obama's health care plan, insurance underwriters will not have the chance to deny someone life over frivolous paperwork errors and those with pre-existing conditions will not face a lapse in care. During the transition, the U.S. Human Expedition will have experts assigned to cases where legitimate claims are denied in the name of money. At one point the military may be in control of medical care so the private distribution of wealth cannot over capitalize on an individual's right to live at the choke point of medical needs and force the inability to fulfill the unrealistic demands of such monetary costs.

The only difference is that odds were if you engaged in violence in a public place, someone with vigilance would put you down on the spot. As shown in many western films, a roughneck walks into a bar with his gun belt on and sees just about everyone else in the bar equally armed. If any drunkards pulled their side-arms inside the bar, the bartender would pull out his shotgun and let you have it if you opened fire. If you were just threatening he would say to take it outside. The fact everyone was armed was the peacekeeper. There was not very many law enforcement around because people defended themselves mainly. Not everyone has the capacity to fight but when push comes to shove, when people absolutely have no other choice they will if they have the means. In this day in age it is easy to terrorize massive groups of people because many abide by the laws making increasingly easier for those who do not to stand there and boundlessly kill with no resistance. The government was never meant to become the shield for the people like that.

We must be able and legally allowed to issue orders that will protect the mission objectives and the people we are reaching out to help. By sitting back and allowing injustice to take place with no course of action, makes us guilty by association. I find it odd how often police officers like to use that term, except fail to understand how it should also apply within the government. In that kind of situation if you are not somehow part of the solution, you are part of the problem and that is exactly what the Somalis saw when our helicopters circled over head and allowed militias to seize the supplies meant for them. Due to the fact not everyone is capable of defending themselves when they are poverty stricken and vulnerable, coming looking for trouble should mean they are going to find it. Allowing an enemy force to take our goods and appear superior or compassionate in our place contradicts our operational purpose. If civilians are being murdered in the presence of Expedition forces, they would naturally call in other branches of the military for support but would have the option to engage the enemy on sight in the mean time. It would be up to the highest rank on the scene to determine if there is a tactical advantage to fighting the enemy. Each explorer will have to make their own personal decision on if they would arm themselves or not and either way, no one would think down on them. I am predicting odds are one out of fifty or sixty explorers would actually be armed in more peaceful areas where occasional violence does occur. In more dangerous areas probably one out of every five or ten explorers will have firearms.

We can take any charitable capitol and use it to buy what we may need to start with at first and establish our first series of \"Domestic Checkpoints\". A Human Expedition checkpoint will develop in levels much like the branch itself will grow in phases. Level one is a basic camp at first where people can go to at least get a meal a few times a day and maybe even sleep on cots or in sleeping bags inside tents. A level one checkpoint prepares for level two if the checkpoint is cleared to become a permanent location and construction based volunteers begin building new shelter. Level two checkpoints are when a building is established such as an apartment or dorm. Each level two checkpoint will also have a kitchen in it so people have a nearby place to go for their meals. Supply missions will bring in goods to checkpoints to keep them up and running. Domestic checkpoint supply missions will usually just by delivery trucks like how we do business normally bringing in supplies to restaurants and stores. In more rural areas or more threatening environments around the world when we expand out, supply missions will come with heavier risk. A level three checkpoint is not much different from level two, level three checkpoints will be a supply depot or focal point to a smaller town or village. If a checkpoint is ready to expand beyond level three it will simply become a base and will have everything that would come with being on a military installation. Expedition bases will all cultivate their own resources at one point. Police departments would have detachments out of the domestic bases and work with liaisons to make sure the peace is being kept during distribution and in living environments provided by the federal government. Any criminal activity engaged in on federal property would be a federal offense like any other federal facility. If the Department of Defense saw it fit to change some non-combative M.O.S.s over to the Human Expedition, it may make us more welcoming in places we already occupy. We can if approved by the right authorities create overseas checkpoints in such areas to see how people warm up to the new way of us doing things. Once we have secured 90% of our domestic population from poverty and have a few successful outreach checkpoints established, we will shift into the beginning of phase three. At this point we should see a significant difference in our peoples increasing faith in the government and decreasing criminal activity and average individual and government debt.\n",

And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.\" If you read the Bible with an open mind, you find that there are a lot of verses that seem to contradict each other, but the bottom line is this: God is the author of marriage, and marriage is between a man and a woman. That's not negotiable. So what's the point of all this \"love the sinner, hate the sin\""

That is a metaphorical way of saying that bodhisattvas are like an uncolored, unmolested stream of water. The same is true of the Buddha-dharma, which is like a waterless well. It is not polluted by defilements, and it does not have anything in it that is impure.\n\nThis is what is meant by the \"physical emphasis\""

This, of course, did not sit well with the UEP's political rivals, who saw the Union as a threat to their power and sought to destroy it at all costs.\n\nThe battle for the Earth was about to begin.\n\nThis is the story of that battle, as told by the people who lived through it.

In other words, it is rationalism as applied to the world at large. Rationalism has its roots in the Greek word rationally, meaning \"in accordance with reason\" or \"based on the best evidence.\" The term was popularized by Immanuel Kant, who wrote \"The Critique of Pure Reason\" in 1781.

Some of these candidates have run as \"conservatives\" or \"libertarians,\" but the truth is that they are not libertarians at all.

This article is an attempt to provide a list of the most bizarre and disturbing ideas that have been put forth by the Libertarian Party candidates so far.

The third approach is called _therapeutic lying_ (fibbing or telling a white lie). There is no clear consensus regarding the use of this approach as it raises questions about honesty, trust and integrity. The level of dementia is recognised as having great relevance on deciding whether therapeutic lying is appropriate or not. The acceptability of therapeutic lying is recognised to be a complex issue and its use depends on a number of factors, including who is lying, the relationships involved, the motive behind the lie, the nature of the lie and the understanding and capacity of the person with dementia and their stage in the disease process. Of particular significance is the apparent high prevalence of therapeutic lying despite the fact that a review of the codes of professional conducts state that the practitioner must tell the truth. In fact being untruthful is likely to put professional registration at risk.

Strategies include both the person with dementia and their carer retreating together into the past, and in doing so, experiencing the lived and more vivid experiences of the person with dementia.

In contrast to living in an unfamiliar present, retreating to a familiar past is far more pleasing and less stressful for the person with dementia (Douglas et al. 2004). According to Kitwood (1997), validation therapy is recognised as offering a good level of empathy with the intention of understanding a person's entire frame of reference. However, researchers argue that, like many psychosocial interventions advocated for use in dementia care, validation therapy does not have a definitive theoretical underpinning and the evidence to support its use stems largely from observational studies. These studies report that, validation therapy promotes better communication and interaction between the carer and person with dementia; it has a positive effect on behavioural symptoms and enhances the quality of life of both carer and person with dementia (Bleathman & Morton, 1988; Babins, 1998). However, converse to findings arising from qualitative studies, evidence from the most recent Cochrane systematic review (Neal & Wright, 2003), evaluating the effectiveness of validation therapy for people with dementia concludes that there is inadequate evidence to support the use of validation therapy for people with dementia. Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this review but because of the diversity in duration of treatment, lack of comparability between control groups and outcome measurements, pooled analysis was not feasible.

Autonomy centres on the person's right to self-determination and the carer's role in promoting independence for the purpose of realising self-determination (Barber & Lyness, 2001). Beneficence is about making decisions that are in the best interest of the person with dementia and non-maleficence is about minimising harm to the person with dementia (Barber & Lyness, 2001). Therapeutic lying can threaten a person's autonomy when it is used to deny the voice of the person with dementia in their care whilst only achieving short term goals such as reducing agitation (Brannelly and Whitewood (2014). However, therapeutic lying may be considered acceptable when non-maleficence and compassion are its motives (Sperber 2014; Stubbs, 2013; Tuckett, 2012). It is also important to consider the impact of therapeutic lying on the carer. Trust is a moral principle of care, and lying compromises the trusting relationship between the person with dementia and their carer (Feil & Altman, 2004; Schermer, 2007; Barnes & Brannelly, 2008). This behaviour/action may therefore have a negative impact on the carer who may feel uncomfortable with the deception and the associated impact on their integrity (Schermer, 2007). The literature also highlights that the stage of dementia is an important consideration when deciding to use therapeutic lying. Taylor (2007), writing from the perspective of the person with dementia, asserts that lying is not acceptable to people in the early stages of dementia as it heightens that disconnect that they experience from reality. However as dementia progresses and capacity diminishes, the less possible it becomes for the person with dementia to entertain beliefs, either false or true. Schermer (2007) purports that lying to someone requires a capacity to hold beliefs about what is true and what is not, thus making it conceptually impossible to lie to someone in an advanced state of dementia. If a person is not aware of being 'lied' to due to memory loss, the 'deception' may be viewed as less threatening and potentially beneficial (Kartalova-O'Doherty et al. 2014). Lying with an intention to cause harm is never acceptable.\n",

They found that the majority of health professionals (96.5%) reported that they lied to residents with dementia. Over half the staff (51.1%) used lying to promote compliance and to benefit staff and save time (30.2%). Likewise, Culley et al. (2013) found that of the 29 psychiatrists surveyed on the use of therapeutic lying, the majority (69%) reported they had lied to people with dementia when it was deemed to be in the best interests of the person. Elvish et al. (2010) also found that lying was more acceptable to health care professionals when the focus was to reduce harm to the person with dementia. Their study used a two phased design, the first of which involved developing and piloting the attitudes towards lying to people with dementia (ALPD) questionnaire; and the second aimed at validating the questionnaire at a workshop. In phase one, participants (n=151), including psychologists, nurses, care workers and social workers, were asked to complete the newly developed questionnaire. Results showed that lying was considered more acceptable when it was in the person's best interest or to prevent injury as opposed to being used for the purpose of compliance. Tuckett (2012) also found lying was used by nurses and allied health professionals (n=18) caring for people with dementia for the purpose of eliminating harm and to control behaviour. In this study, the consequences of lying were important as identified by the concept of'settling' a resident by lying to them. Participants identified validating the person with dementia's reality as benevolent lying as opposed to 'out and out' lying. It is interesting to note that despite the fact that professional guidelines and codes of conduct do not support lying to patients irrespective of cognitive status health professionals report that lying to people with dementia is an approach they use (Culley et al. 2013; Tuckett 2012, Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2009; James et al. 2006)\n",

For example, a study by D'Arcy et al. (2011) found that the more an individual's life is dependent on others, the more likely they are to lie in order to protect their self-interest. The authors suggest that this may be due to the belief that others will take advantage of them and their relationship with them deteriorate over time. Another explanation is that people with dementia feel a sense of helplessness and lack of control over their life and are willing to do anything to avoid being left alone in their care and living with a caregiver who is unsupportive or neglectful.

In other words, one's dignity is determined by one's life and not by external or extrinsic factors.\n\nAccording to these definitions, there are at least four ways in which people can be treated as having less dignity than others: (1) by being deprived of rights, (2) by being discriminated against, (3) by being subjected to physical or psychological abuse, and (4) by being forced to work for less than fair wages.

Jacobson argues that every human interaction has the potential to be a 'dignity encounter'. These encounters she argues can result in one of two outcomes: the promotion of dignity or the violation of dignity. Dignity violation is more likely to result from an encounter in which there is a power imbalance with one person placed in a position of vulnerability due for example to cognitive impairment as in the case of the person with dementia. The impact is further exacerbated when the other actor is not sympathetic due to prejudice, personality or ignorance. The setting in which encounters take place can also exacerbate the situation. So-called harsh environments that fail to take account of the diversity of users, serve to reinforce distance and power imbalances. Jacobson (2009) characterises these settings as hierarchal and inflexible characterised by stress and a sense of urgency but deficient in resources. The people working in such environments are less likely to be empathetic to others and are also more likely to perceive questioning or non-cooperation as an 'attack on their dignity'. Being in a 'position' of vulnerability is at the core of dignity violation.

This chapter will look at the concept of dignity in a historical context and how it came to be associated with the rights-based argument for social contract theory.\n\nLocke's view of dignity is closely related to that of Hobbes, who argued that human beings are endowed with a sense of their own dignity and that this sense is based on the fact that each person is the end of his or her own creation.[1] In other words, Locke believed that the individual is the centre of the universe and that all other things are subordinate to her, not in a way that makes them subservient to the individual but in a way that makes them dependent"

The former perspective was grounded in the belief that telling the truth is always the right thing to do, the latter that the situation colours what is right. The acceptability of lying was linked to the person's altered awareness as distinct from stage of dementia, as participants pointed out these are not necessarily the same. They indicated that characteristic of a \"good\" or acceptable lie is the intention to benefit the person, for example, to minimise or not cause distress. Acceptable approaches were distracting or avoiding as opposed to outright lying or deceiving (i.e. the latter was considered not in the interests of the person). Participants made clear that the action taken must be respectful and mindful of the person's dignity, self-esteem and self-efficacy. Under no circumstances should the person's autonomy and control be undermined by the action taken. At different points of awareness the risks vs. benefits of lying must be considered in taking the decision. Lying is acceptable when on balance the outcome benefits the person with dementia.

Carer participants expressed concern however, that lying could increase the person with dementia's confusion or negatively impact on their relationship with the person. Several alternative strategies to managing the person's anxiety, stress or agitation were identified. These ranged from: telling the truth, moving on the conversation, reframing the situation, distraction and \"going with\" the person. Carer participants did however confront or correct the person if they believed it was in their best interests. \"Empathetic deception\" captures their approach to \"lying\" or telling the truth: it was done in the person's best interest, in context of knowing what matters to the person and in a way that maintained the person's dignity. The person's capacity (loosely aligned to stage of dementia) was also considered and reflected in using different types of strategies e.g. it was more likely that carers would tell the truth in earlier stages and lie by omission or avoidance in the later stages. At the heart of carers' actions was the intention to benefit the person. They viewed an individualised approach, tailored to the person's needs and life history as critical, they questioned the benefit of hard and fast rules on \"what to do\" therefore. In context of the actions that formal carers should take, carers saw that therapeutic lying was appropriate when it benefited and respected the person's dignity. They viewed themselves as the representatives of the person with dementia's personhood in the later stages because they knew them, knew their life history and knew what mattered to them. Consequently they considered they had a role to play in preserving the person. They advised that in formal care settings a care plan should be agreed that reflected this knowledge.\n",

However, the nature of the lie as well as the intention matters. A small lie (for example, reframing, distracting or moving the conversation on) was acceptable, whereas a blatant lie with the intention to fool or manipulate the person was not acceptable. The person's beliefs and values must be central to the decision on what action to take. The person's awareness of his/her deficits must also be considered (loosely linked to stage of dementia). Carer participants indicated that knowing the person and what was appropriate to and for them was critical. Both groups flagged the importance of maintaining the person's dignity and respecting his/her personhood. The risk-benefit of therapeutic lying should be assessed in context of the individual needs therefore. Furthermore the actions of formal carers should be negotiated and agreed with carers and/or the person with dementia where possible.

The Delphi technique is a multistage process involving a series of questionnaire rounds, interspersed by controlled feedback based on the results of previous rounds that seek to gain the most reliable consensus of opinion of a group of experts (Linstone & Turoff, 1975; Gordon & Pease, 2005; Vernon, 2009). It involves progressive rounds of survey construction, analysis and iterative revision until predefined criteria for consensus are reached. Participants receive feedback on responses to previous rounds and can use this feedback to inform their decisions about future survey responses and the process continues until there is emergence of consensus (Gordon & Pease 2006; Vernon 2009). Delphi studies commonly comprise three rounds before consensus is achieved (Hasson et al. 2000; Hanafin & Brooks 2005).

(2) What is the most popular OSM feature? (3) Do people feel that OpenStreetMap is a community or a product? These questions are discussed in terms of their impact on user satisfaction, which has been shown to be a key determinant of OSM adoption (Bouwmeester and van der Ploeg 2009). Our focus is on the first question, which asks respondents to select the number of people they have heard of and the most popular feature in the map that they are familiar with. For this survey, \"familiarity\" was defined as the number of times a respondent had seen the feature in an OSM map, and \"own\" was defined as the number of times a respondent had created a feature or contributed to the development of a feature. This definition does not take into account the use of features that are not on the map, such as road and rail data, and is consistent with the approach taken"

The panel may choose to conduct a pre-qualification interview with a representative sample of the panel members to determine whether they are well-suited to serve on the panel.

They viewed themselves as the representatives of the person with dementia in the later stages because they knew them, knew their life history and knew what mattered to them. At the heart of informal/unpaid carers actions was the intention to benefit the person with dementia and they reported that therapeutic lying was appropriate when it benefited and respected the person's dignity. A few informal/unpaid carers in the current study reported that they sometimes felt uncomfortable 'lying' to the person with dementia as it might increase the person with dementia's confusion or negatively impact on their relationship. However, similar to the findings in (Green 2015), it appeared that the benefits of reducing upset for the person with dementia offset these concerns. The use of therapeutic lying therefore in instances when people with dementia who ask questions or make statements that are false is, similar to the literature, deemed to be an acceptable strategy both by health professionals, informal/unpaid carers and people with dementia.

In this context, acceptable approaches included therapeutic lying as well as the use of distraction and avoiding the false statement or question asked. Participants were clear that the dignity of the person with dementia must never be undermined and highlighted the importance of trust in relationships and the importance of carers taking time to get to know and understand the person. Such encounters have the potential to promote dignity (Jacobson 2012). The environment where two people meet is also important. If the person with dementia does not feel safe and secure then the potential for violation of dignity is increased. Finally, the policy and social context, within which encounters take place, has a major influence on whether encounters will promote or violate dignity.

The consensus is that there is no single approach that will suit each person or be appropriate every time. Rather than prescriptive guidelines carers should undertake an individualised assessment that enables a judgement to be made as to the best approach to take in any given context A key requirement for making these judgements is that carers must know the person with dementia including their preferences and know what their families think. In the context of nursing home care the detailed life history of the person with dementia is considered crucial to this process. Consequently the governance structure within which practitioners are working must take cognisance of this and focus on capacity development for carers through training and education as opposed to creating a prescriptive model of care. It is also clear that a discrepancy exists between respective health professional codes of conduct and ethical guidelines and health professionals use of therapeutic lying, which is an alternative approach to truth telling or correcting the person with dementia. This has serious practical implications for health professionals. This paradox also increases the risk for violation of the dignity of people with dementia and of professional carers and therefore the regulatory frameworks merit urgent review and attention.\n",

This was consistent with findings from other studies (e.g. Belsky et al., 2011), but may be a result of the nature of the study, which was cross-sectional rather than longitudinal in nature. In addition, there was no difference in the amount of time spent reading between paid and informal carers.\n\nOur study has limitations. First, the sample size was small and it is possible that we under-estimated the prevalence of engagement in self-help activities and/or under-estimated the extent to which these activities were time-limited. Second, we did not have information on the frequency of use of RBT, which is an important area for future research. Third, we were unable to assess quality of care and the relationship between carers' time use and outcome.

He'd forced himself to suppress as much of that emotion as he could for the sake of a smooth transition to a new life, pushing aside anything that might make him regret the decision. Now it seemed circumstance had pulled those memories to the surface once more. So vivid were they that a thought began to form in his mind, starting as a question and expanding rapidly to a doubt that was not easily shaken off. A sun like Earth's sun, lighting a day the duration of Earth's day, with air and water and plants and animals just like those of Earth. Might it be that his expected purpose had been abandoned after all? Was it possible that instead of being thrown further into the unknown universe than any other human being, he had simply been returned home?

He had immediately begun devising plans for future projects by which some of this material might be smelted and forged. There were even nuggets of gold, both sizeable and numerous, in the same area. He imagined that these might be useful as well - if he could think of something to use them for. It amused him to recall that there had been periods of his life when gold was thought so rare and valuable that a person might spend years searching for a few flecks of it, and other times when it was considered a disposable waste, when whole dwellings might be build of solid bricks of purified gold just to avoid the effort of throwing them away.\n",

There was an electric fire pit, as well as a woodstove for cooking in the winter.\n\nI had no idea at the time how much work went into the cabin, but after talking to some of the people who worked on it, I'm pretty sure it took at least a year to build and probably more than that in the construction phase. And that's without taking into account the labor involved in harvesting the trees that were used for the building materials.\n\nSo how do you go about building a cabin out of wood? You start by cutting down a bunch of trees, which is a lot easier than it sounds. The tree trunks have to be felled with a chainsaw, and then the wood has to be sawed into planks that"

        "reference_text": ", an accurate reflection of both its size and colour in comparison to the surrounding region. It had a number of features that had drawn it to his attention over a period of several days' observation. Firstly it was cleanly circular in shape. Of course that was difficult to know for sure given its small size, but it seemed to lack the irregular border of other surface features giving it an unnatural appearance. Secondly, it sat very neatly on the divide between two of the major masses of near black - the dark green of Grand Australis on the left, and the even larger mass of dark red to the right, which was north. Whatever those colour variations might signify, that placement seemed to be purposeful. Like the Mid Range mountains far off to the south-west, it appeared to have an effect on the patterns of cloud and weather around it, and looked to be casting a particularly long shadow at the appropriate times of day when conditions were clear enough to see it. Moreover when the clouds in its vicinity were calm it often even appeared above them, a clear brown dot on a field of white. All of this suggested its true size was very large for such an isolated thing. And when the surrounding surface was darkened by shadow or night, it was that spot which most often marked concentrations of faint points of light nearby. Finally there were recent measurements which placed it almost, but not quite, at the very centre of the disk from his point of view, and subsequent very rough calculations suggesting the deviation was more due to his own position than its. If those estimates were correct, he surmised, by the time he reached his destination at Ninety Long that spot would be at the exact point on the surface of Lune closest to him.\n",

Where to look was in the outskirts of the City along the inside of the perimeter wall - the rural hinterland.

There were kinds of food here that he had seen nowhere else on NewEarth - exotic vegetables and hybrid fruits that combined a variety of forms and flavours, and chicken meat, and slabs of beef bark extruded from the walls and floor - artificial, engineered raw ingredients specifically designed to sustain the primitive human form and culture in an artificial world, far removed from its original home.

He pressed the button again, returning the visage to the outside world. Now he moved the joystick. Nothing changed. He selected one of the three sliders and tried to move it - it did not budge, not even slightly. He tried a second slider. It moved easily, and as it did the sun and sky faded as if viewed through heavy sunshades, disappearing into darkness only with the slider pushed all the way to the left. He moved it back to the right, past its initial position, and was forced to close his eyes as the ambient glare ramped up beyond tolerable levels.

He could see vast tracts of flat dark red plain that were featureless even at high magnification except for structures that cast discernible shadows even against the glossy near black of the surface surrounding them, shadows that shifted with the motion of the sun. Up close they must have been huge. He could see the distinctive and very recognisable outline of terramines, some of which trailed long plumes of vapour in the prevailing winds.

It felt particularly appropriate that his life in the habitats of Orion should be called to mind at that moment. It had been there that the knowledge of a race of beings not descended from humanity was first revealed to him. For all of history prior to that discovery, human beings, for all they knew with any certainty, might very well have been alone in the cosmos. Indeed, prior to that, life of any sort might have been thought unique to Earth or to those places contaminated by explorers originating on Earth, and that despite hundreds of worlds having been reached and examined. Such is the rarity with which the miracle of life spontaneously brings itself into being. But somewhere in the interval between falling asleep in his home on Aurigae and waking up in a new home on Orion, life had been found and confirmed. Not once, but several times. Of course there had been ample time for it - that interval had spanned tens of millennia and in that time the children of humanity had increased their dominion of the Milky Way by many thousandfold. That news had reached him only later as it criss crossed the expanding bubble of human occupation at the snail's pace of light speed. Most noteworthy of all were the signs, so faint across the great gulf of intergalactic space that they could be discerned at all only by vast instruments, and even then only at the limits of resolution of those instruments, of activity by an intelligence on par with that of humanity in a galaxy some thirteen million light-years distant. In spite of their weakness it had been demonstrated beyond any reasonable expression of doubt that intelligent activity was the cause of those signs. He could still recall hearing the news for the first time, the discussions with his companions in the caverns of Orion who had become casual experts in its interpretation, the mind numbing technical arguments by which those interpretations had been confirmed over the course of centuries of analysis. He could still, even after all the intervening time, put names and occasional faces to some of those companions - Fritz-Biscane who was thin and wiry and understood exo-biochemistry and abiogenesis, and Tulley, exactly the opposite in appearance who had studied the evolutionary history of both terrestrial and non-terrestrial life.

Planets on which aboriginal life of even the simplest kind had come to exist were rare in the universe. They were known to be rare. The conditions which led to the spontaneous formation of living matter were tightly constrained, and the obstacles to its formation were numerous. And planets where aboriginal life thrived and evolved were even rarer. As a youth, living and growing on Earth, not a single instance other than Earth itself was known. Not one. Indeed by the time the first such example was confirmed in the Milky Way, the number of planets supporting relocated colonies of terrestrial life exceeded all those supporting native life that would ever be found in that galaxy. He himself had visited or occupied several worlds other than Earth, and had lived several lifetimes separated by millennia of sleep, before learning that organisms not descended from those of his own homeworld even existed. By that time the rarity of naturally occurring living ecosystems had become a point of moral concern in its own right. Such planets were afforded protection from any and all interference. For the sake of curiosity, non-terrestrial life could be studied, but only on the proviso and to the extent that the flow of information from those studies was strictly one way. Natural human senses were far too clumsy to provide any assurance to that effect, and so human flesh, in any of its forms, had never been in direct contact with any life not drawn from the ecosystems of Earth.\n",

Back to when the stars and the patterns they formed on the sky had only ever been seen from a single point in space and very nearly a single point in time. Back to the childhood of humanity, and to his own childhood, on Earth. There those patterns of stars appeared fixed and eternal, and because they were fixed they could be identified with names that stuck for the lifetimes of those that named them, and their children, and their grandchildren. They were named for animals - lions and bulls and scorpions. They were named for people - hunters and maidens and water bearers. They were named for things - scales and crosses. And they were named for mythical beasts like the one with the head and chest of a human and the hindquarters of a horse - the Centaur. Even when it became known that those patterns were not fixed - not just as a theory but as the real passage of time and the shifting perspective across huge spans of space had distorted them beyond all recognition - even when the original namers had been dead for many generations - even then some part of those names could be found clinging to some of the stars and other objects that had made up the patterns originally. And so it was when the very first evidence of mind on a par with that which had long before descended from humankind was discovered and confirmed, it was discovered in a galaxy that had once occupied the pattern of the Centaur. The galaxy itself had been renamed and renumbered so often that all connection to its origin was broken. The priests of OldEarth had called it Tingard, a name whose origin was itself an entirely different story. But the beings that lived there, whose activities had been seen from so great a distance, even when nothing else at all was known about them, were given a name that retained some shadow of that long history: Kenthoni - those that dwell with the Centaurs.\n",

It was entirely possible that the modes of thinking he was accustomed to would not be adequate for that task, dealing as they were with a system of biology and cognition different from anything anyone of his kind had ever experienced. Or it might equally have a perfectly mundane explanation - some of these creatures were fearful and hateful of anything appearing in their world as new or strange while others were tolerant and accepting. Was that really so different from what might be expected of his own race - indeed what he knew to be the case from history, and had frequently observed with his own eyes? It even made sense that this would be the case. Life was fragile and its continued existence required treading the fine line marking the boundary between those circumstances necessary to maintain it, and those circumstances sufficient to extinguish it. Where the environment alone did not guarantee that line could be held, intelligence arose to force it actively, and the more delicate and complex the balancing act became, the more intelligence evolved to sustain it.

It suggested personality, diversity of opinion and abstraction of thought - the very traits he had come to find.

Was it something that had been expected, even anticipated, or was it a culture shock that felt to them like an invasion? And what knowledge of him did they possess before he had appeared in front of them? Did they have any contact with the Hosts, and how were they related to the Hosts?

So he simply looked at it from a respectful distance without touching it, noting and sketching the details of its appearance - its slightly elongated bulky body with no clear distinction between head and tail, its three groups of stubby wings, fore, mid and aft, its four circles of raised iridescent bumps front and back that he took to be compound eye spots, its several rows top and bottom of legs, or antennae, or both, the black and bright green loops and swirls like fingerprints marking the rest of its surface - and then left it where it lay.

Initially not overly worried he continued walking, though with the faint air of someone moving through a potentially hostile neighbourhood. A vibration through the ground and a rhythmic mechanical sound drew his attention back to the hive. It was no longer just the dark cloud of wasps that had become active - the rusty mount it was sitting on was billowing plumes of black smoke that quickly settled into grey wisps. It jerked from side to side once or twice and began to inch forward, its huge caterpillar treads visibly churning the ground as they started to rotate. The thing was indeed mobile as he had suspected - remarkably mobile in fact as it picked up speed - and heading in his direction. Even then he was more intrigued than concerned, but nonetheless thought it best not to wait so exposed to assess its intentions, and picked up his own pace towards the safety of the airlock. His concern grew with the realisation that a combination of his own hobbled pace and the considerable speed the vehicle had attained would easily place it between himself and his goal. To make the situation worse, long before the gap between them had closed the malleable form of the kenthoni rider began stretching itself towards him. His final faint hope that this might be a display of innocent curiosity was dashed when the swarm hit with both substantial force and deliberate intent. With astonishing precision and dexterity a volley of wasp strikes knocked him face first to the ground with well aimed blows to the back of his knees, and pinned him there by concerted attention to his legs, back and wrists - a constant stream of impacting insects delivering a continuous force that made very effective shackles. It was as if they had contemplated his possible vulnerabilities and were now testing those ideas - successfully. They proceeded then to strip the worm silk from his skin and clothes, and he briefly had an idea that they might have been trying to help him, until they started using it with great skill to bind him even further. Within minutes he was completely immobilised. The physical assault subsided enough for him to sense the vibrations through the ground becoming stronger and the mechanical throbbing of the mobile becoming louder. From his prone position he was able to see the huge vehicle coming closer, and for a terrifying moment he thought it would run right over him. But it rolled slowly past, its great metal treads mere meters from his head - close enough that he could feel the coarse clay dirt crack under the weight, close enough that he could feel greasy black lubricant from the axles splashing him, close enough that he could tell its rust red appearance was more than just a colour choice. The thing really did appear to be made of rusted iron, honed smooth and functional as a building material in its own right, but creating to his eyes the impression of great age and ongoing deterioration, as if it had been salvaged from a junkyard.

Even with that support he tried and failed several times to reach the rope, every attempt bringing him closer to the exhaustion and muscle fatigue he knew was to be avoided if he was to keep any gains he made. It was only by digging IceNeedle into the bark and hoisting against it that he was able to gain the few additional inches needed to take hold of the knotted end of the rope. By the greatest of good fortune the putrid water of the pool, which by first impressions felt slippery with concentrated organic slime, held just enough grit to provide purchase on the rope, allowing him to pull up and latch himself to it.\n",

The whole thing was constantly rumbling and vibrating in a coarse low bass as it moved, and vents along the side exuded frequent puffs of vapour and dribbles of liquid. He also noted that many of the wasps busied themselves constantly picking up scraps of pulverised sponge grass from the ground as they passed, shredding it further with their own bodies and feeding it into openings an the back.

Evolution had somehow managed to construct a mind with the capacity to understand the entire universe from the very smallest particle of matter to superclusters of galaxies, from the very earliest moment of time to its eventual end in cold, diffuse emptiness. Scales of existence that had no bearing on parochial tooth and claw survival and adaptability, the guiding hands by which evolution sculpted its forms, somehow managed to be included in the results. But to evolve a mind able to understand itself, that had always seemed too great a feat to ask. So for much of humanity's push to understand the universe in which it existed, the mind itself was not thought part of that universe. From that error had arisen various forms of superstition and religion and spurious philosophy that had continued to influence human thinking and delay human progress even well into his own early days. That idea had long ago been proven to be untrue, but the human mind had certainly not evolved to understand itself. Indeed it had always been imagined that it could not have evolved to understand itself.

The eclipse also provided a fixed reference by which he could compare the positions of the stars night after night. He observed and measured noteworthy groupings of stars as they disappeared behind the eastern edge of the lunar disk at the moment the eclipse was at its maximum, only to see them re-emerge from the western edge at the same moment two weeks later.
